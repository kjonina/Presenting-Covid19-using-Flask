# Tidying Data, Plotly and Flask

## Upgrading Graphs
In January 2022, I was tasked with creating five different graphs to visualise COVID-19 cases. 

At the time I focused on the following learning outcomes:
- Create at least one animation
- Create at least one dual axis plot
- Create at least one plot where two graphs are demonstrated side by side

In June 2024, I am revising my choices.

### Figure 3
I was highly influenced by [Hans Rosling's amazing Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w&ab_channel=TED) which demonstrates the sheer power of a great data visusalisation. Although I am proud of learning how to do animated plot in plotly, it should not have been used.

### Figure 5
I have no excuses. This needs to be fixed.
