# Tidying Data, Plotly and Flask

## Upgrading Graphs
In January 2022, I was tasked with creating five different graphs to visualise COVID-19 daily cases, daily hospitalisation with COVID and Daily ICU Numbers. 

At the time I focused on the following learning outcomes:
- Create at least one animation
- Create at least one dual axis plot
- Create at least one plot where two graphs are demonstrated side by side

In June 2024, I am revising my choices for **FIgure 3** and **Figure 5**

### Figure 1
Overall data visualisation of COVID-19 cases in Ireland.

### Figure 2
Allows the user to select the *age group* and see the change in the COVID-19 cases for that age group

### Figure 3
I was highly influenced by [Hans Rosling's amazing Ted Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w&ab_channel=TED) which demonstrates the sheer power of a great data visusalisation. Although I am proud of learning how to do animated plot in plotly, it should not have been used.

### Figure 4
Using dual axis to demonstrate the differences between median and number of COVID-19 cases.

### Figure 5

Aim: to show that older people were hospitalised more often than young people
Result: reliance on piechart to show percentage and causing confusion. Completely missing the point I was trying to show!
